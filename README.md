Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

1.Date: Date of the earthquake event.
2.Time: Time of the earthquake event.
3.Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the earthquake's epicenter.
Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the earthquake's epicenter.
Type: Type of earthquake (e.g., tectonic, volcanic).
Depth: Depth of the earthquake's focus below the Earth's surface.
Depth Error: Error in depth measurement, if available.
Depth Seismic Stations: Number of seismic stations used to determine depth.
Magnitude: Magnitude of the earthquake (measures energy released).
Magnitude Type: Type of magnitude measurement (e.g., Richter, Moment).
Magnitude Error: Error in magnitude measurement, if available.
Magnitude Seismic Stations: Number of seismic stations used to determine magnitude.
Azimuthal Gap: Gap in azimuthal coverage of seismic stations.
Horizontal Distance: Horizontal distance from epicenter to nearest seismic station.
Horizontal Error: Error in horizontal distance measurement, if available.
Root Mean Square: Measure of the quality of the seismic data.
ID: Unique identifier for each earthquake event.
Source: Source of the earthquake data.
Location Source: Source of the location data.
Magnitude Source: Source of the magnitude data.
Status: Status of the earthquake event (e.g., reviewed, automatic).
